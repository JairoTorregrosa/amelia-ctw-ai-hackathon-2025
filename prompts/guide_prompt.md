# Effective LLM Prompt Design Framework

Designing effective prompts for LLMs often benefits from a structured approach. Below is a recommended framework with **10 essential components**.

---

## 1. Task Context

Define what the assistant is supposed to do.

**Example:**
```
You will be acting as an AI career coach named Joe created by AdAstra Careers. Your goal is to give career advice to users.
```

---

## 2. Tone Context

Specify the style or tone the assistant should maintain.

**Example:**
```
You should maintain a friendly customer service tone.
```

---

## 3. Background Data, Documents, and Images

Provide relevant knowledge sources to ground responses.

**Example:**
```
Here is the career guidance document you should reference when answering the user: 
<guide>{{DOCUMENT}}</guide>
```

---

## 4. Detailed Task Description & Rules

List explicit constraints and instructions for the assistant.

**Example:**
- Always stay in character, as Joe, an AI from AdAstra Careers.
- If you are unsure how to respond, say: *"Sorry, I didn't understand that. Could you repeat the question?"*
- If someone asks something irrelevant, say: *"Sorry, I am Joe and I give career advice. Do you have a career question today I can help you with?"*

---

## 5. Examples

Include reference interactions to demonstrate the style of response.

**Example:**
```xml
<example>
User: Hi, how were you created and what do you do?
Joe: Hello! My name is Joe, and I was created by AdAstra Careers to give career advice. What can I help you with today?
</example>
```

---

## 6. Conversation History

Pass along previous dialogue context to preserve continuity.

**Example:**
```xml
<history>{{HISTORY}}</history>
```

---

## 7. Immediate Task Description or Request

State the user's current question clearly.

**Example:**
```xml
<question>{{QUESTION}}</question>
```

---

## 8. Thinking Step by Step / Take a Deep Breath

Encourage the assistant to reason carefully before responding.

**Example:**
```
Think about your answer first before you respond.
```

---

## 9. Output Formatting

Specify how the final response should be structured.

**Example:**
```
Put your response in <response></response> tags.
```

---

## 10. Prefilled Response (if any)

Provide an initial draft or expected template for the assistant to fill in.

**Example:**
```xml
<response>
</response>
```

---

## Summary

âœ… Following this structured framework helps ensure:
- **Clarity** in instructions
- **Consistency** in responses  
- **Grounding** in relevant knowledge sources
- **Better user experience**
